    QNG_infantry_equipment_pre_rifle_2_desc: "Prior to the introduction of the bayonet in the late 17th century, the pike and shot was a historical infantry tactical formation that initially arose during the Italian Wars of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Troops armed with pikes and soldiers equipped with arquebuses and/or muskets formed this sort of configuration. Other weapons, like as swords, halberds, and crossbows, were used on occasion."

    FRA_infantry_equipment_rifle_0_desc: "In 1826, the Lieutenant Henri-Gustave Delvigne invented a new method for rifled guns. The chamber of the rifle was smaller than the bore, with which it was connected by a spherical surface equal in radius to the ball used. The powder was poured from the muzzle into the chamber, upon which the ball rested when dropped into the bore. When forced against the chamber rim by ramming (with three strokes of a heavy ram), the bullet would become deformed and flatten, so as to expand in diameter against the inside of the bore, allowing the bullet to press against the rifling grooves. When fired, the bullet would accompany the rifling and spin."
