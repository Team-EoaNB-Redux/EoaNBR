 AUS_Compromise_Achieved: "The Compromise Achieved"
 AUS_Compromise_Achieved_desc: "Due to the handling of the situation, Franz Joseph managed to stop further unrest from plauging the already exhuasted empire. However, a compromise was founded in these hard times, which, for the better or worse, has established Hungary as a equal of Austria, with Franz Joseph now reining as Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary respectively.\n\nReactions are mixed within the Dual Monarchy, but one thing is sure: Austria, Hungary and their loyal subjects will advance together in these hard times."

 AUS_HUN_December_Constitution: "The December Constitution "
 AUS_HUN_December_Constitution_desc: "It is no secret that the empire has, under some unfortunate circumstances, been forced to adapt. However, we must make with what we have, and as per the requests of the Liberal faction, we have begun to establish a new constitution. While some might protest the decision, Franz Joseph is forced to limit his power, or risk backlash from the rapidly rising Liberals.\n\nHow we handle the creation of it is up to us, but we will need to allow for equality between all the minorities to be established, and the creation of somewhat autonomous entities. Furthermore, the Imperial Council shall take up some duties from Franz Joseph, slowly abolishing the Autocracy of our nation."
 AUS_HUN_Bourgeois_Cabinet: "The Bourgeois Cabinet"
 AUS_HUN_Bourgeois_Cabinet_desc: "With the establishment of the December constitution, which saw many Liberal reforms enacted, the popularity of the Liberal faction within the Imperial government has rapidly expanded, and it seems as if the days of the Aristocratic cabinet is numbered. While Franz-Joseph is not supportive of the Reformists, it would be best to promote progressivism, and to advance our society forward.\n\nCount Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, along with several other Liberals, Reformists and Progressives, are to form a new cabinet to stabilize the situation of the Dual-Monarchy."
 AUS_HUN_Abrogate_Concordat: "Abrogate the Concordat"
 AUS_HUN_Abrogate_Concordat_desc: "The Concordat of 1855 during its implementation was relatively popular, marking reconciliation with the Catholic church, and letting said church sway power over Marriages, Censorship and Education. While it may have served the interests of the Clergy and Absolutists, it certainly did not of the average citizen of the Empire.\n\nAs the Dual-Monarchy is slowly turning more reformist, we come to the issue of the Concordat. While some of its laws could be intergrated into the December Constitution, it as a concept will be abolished. This will also see the implementation of eventual Secular Education and the restoration of Civil Marriages."

 AUS_HUN_Electoral_Reform_1: "Electoral Reform in Cisleithania "
 AUS_HUN_Electoral_Reform_1_desc: "With the ratification of the December constituion and the Imperial Cabinet empowered a long discussed topic comes into our eye, that being elections. While we are no stranger to such, it has usually been only between the Aristocracy, Imperial Council and Emperor. Democracy is a foreign concept to the Dual-Monarchies, and while we wont empower the lower-class just yet, we will begin to reform the electoral system of the Austrian crownlands, Cisleithania.\n\nWhile the House of Lords has been extended into the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, that being the Hungarian monarchy, Austria's rising liberalization has marked the call for a more fairer electoral system. The Bourgeoisie, or middle class, will be allowed to partake in elections issued in Cisleithania, as promised by the Augsleich compromise. For now, the Austrian half will experiment the concept of a contained democracy."

 AUS_HUN_Galician_Sejm_desc: "While many would like to see the abolishment of Habsburg authority in the Dual-Monarchy, there still remain some ethnicities loyal to us. The Polish, mostly within the Governorate of Galicia-Lodomeria have proved themselves loyal to far, and remain a royalist stronghold. Such loyalty cannot go unnoticed, and with the Liberals establishing their own cabinet, we will take up action to reward our subjects.\n\nThe Polish are to be given self-governance to establish the Kingdom of Galicia-Lodomeria, which will act similar to the Hungarians, albeit remaining under the Austrian empire. A regional parliament, known as 'Sejm' will be established, to take up concerns of the Polish regions and put them forward to Vienna."

 AUS_HUN_United_Economy_desc: "The Austrian economy was some 100 years ago the most dominant within the Germanic sphere. While the economy did experience a brief rise in between the Austro-Sardinian war and Second Schelswig war, our distastorous defeat against the inferior Northern Germans has scared not only the military, but also the economy.\n\nIn order to recover from the loss of the German Confederation, we will need to rapidly modernize and industrialize our nation. The Austro-Hungarian economy is currently a decentralized powderkeg, and we will need to renovate the system within the forseeable future, if we do not want to throw the Habsburgs into their deathbed."

 AUS_HUN_Rapid_Industrialisation_desc: "While Austria-Hungary currently has seen a reliable, albeit lackluster growth via trade and agriculture which cannot continue. The vast nations of America, Britain and France all acheived their sizeable economies via industrialization. While the Austrian-half of the empire has seen some establishment of manufactoriers in Prag and Wien, we will need to expand our projects of industrialization to Galicia, Illyria and Hungary. Similar to a human body, all organs need to work in unison for their survival, we all need to aid each other in this.\n\nWe will use our vast treasury to subsidize German and Hungarian corporations and businesses, and also begin to construct state-directed factoriers within major urban centers, to also kickstart urbanization, which will eventually see us rivaling the other industrial powerhouses."
