    institution_rationalism: "Rationalism"

    institution_industrialization: "Industrialization"
    institution_industrialization_desc: "Industrialization, or the Industrial Revolution, was a period from the late eighteenth to early nineteenth centuries in which a transition from hand production methods to machines occurred, as well as increased use of steam and water power. It also boosted the use of textiles, as the textile industry was the first to use these modern production methods. The start of the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, as most of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin and design. The Industrial Revolution was one of the most major turning points in history, second only to the adoption of agriculture."

    institution_mechanization: "Mechanization"
    institution_mechanization_desc: "Mechanization involves the mass transition from hand production methods to machines. Once this is completed, the speed at which we can produce things will increase by a lot due to the automatic process that these machines have. We can use things such as steam or water to help further the automatic process. Alongside these developments, the idea of heavy industrialization will spread further amongst the nations, as they attempt to keep up with the rest of the world."

    institution_electrification: "Electrification"
    institution_electrification_desc: "We can start to convert a good amount of our power away from fossil fuels and into electricity from sources such as water, steam, and wind. We can also use this in the industrial sector in order to use less fossil fuels, and use more renewable energy sources in order to increase efficiency and decrease pollution. We can also use electricity to artificially illuminate our cities as well, with newer light bulbs and other inventions coming into being."

    institution_mass_transit: "Mass Transit"
    institution_mass_transit_desc: "New innovations has led to better methods of transportation, such as better roads, buses, and integrated tram systems. We can now harness the idea of mass transit across our nation, improving the way we transport goods, people, and military equipment. This can allow for rapid military deployment when needed, and for our troops to receive better supply, due to new and faster logistical connections."

    institution_telecommunications: "Telecommunications"
    institution_telecommunications_desc: "Through the method of communicating via wire, air and optics, telecommunications allowed the transfer of information across the world at speeds previously unimaginable. The ease of transmitting data, news and the like allowed information to spread much more quickly to the general populace, the government and command structures. This has in turn brought about many changes in how both people and nations view and access information about places beyond their own domain."

    institution_green_revolution: "Green Revolution"
    institution_green_revolution_desc: "Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, new and efficient food production methods were introduced into developing countries, which led to a significant rise in the production of staple grains (particularly wheat and rice). Significant quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides achieve much higher crop yields, which raises concerns about its expense and potential impact on the environment. Also, poor farmer' harvests now have comparatively lower yields under these new developments because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides."

    institution_computing: "Computing"
    institution_computing_desc: "Computing is the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes and the development of both hardware and software. These innovations have far-reaching effects, reaching into the scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological, and social aspects. The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating, which was an occupation that fell into the hands of the human-computer prior to the invention of mechanical computing machines."

    institution_internet: "Internet"
    institution_internet_desc: "The Internet, a systemic design that allows different computer networks all over the world to communicate, has transformed the way the world communicates and its methods of commerce. Every person who connects to one of its constituent networks has access to the Internet's vast and all-encompassing capabilities, which can be used for virtually any purpose. It enables human interaction through electronic mail, chat rooms, newsgroups, and audio/video transmission across long distances. A vast and expanding number of online businesses ("e-businesses") that conduct a majority of their services via the Internet have found success."

    institution_automation: "Automation"
    institution_automation_desc: "Automation refers to a broad spectrum of technologies that minimize human involvement in processes. When decision criteria, subprocess linkages, and related actions are predetermined and implemented into machines, the need for human intervention is decreased. A massive industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals is one example of automation, but it can also refer to smaller applications like a thermostat controlling a boiler. Control complexity can vary greatly, from straightforward on-off control to high-level multivariable algorithms simplified for easy everyday use."

    institution_settlement: "Settlement"
    institution_settlement_desc: "A settlement institution is a type of organization that aims to improve the lives of people in urban communities through social, educational, and cultural programs. Settlement institutions were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a response to urbanization and industrialization. They were founded by social reformers who believed that urbanization brought social problems, such as poverty and crime, and sought to address them through community-based solutions. Settlement institutions offer a wide range of services, including adult education, childcare, recreation, health services, and advocacy. They continue to play an important role in building strong, healthy communities and promoting social justice."

    institution_centralization: "Centralization"
    institution_centralization_desc: "The institution of centralization is a system in which decision-making authority and power are concentrated at the top of a hierarchical organization. This type of institution is common in both the public and private sectors, where decisions are made by a small group of individuals at the top of the organization, rather than distributed throughout the organization. The centralization of authority can provide several benefits, such as faster decision-making, greater consistency in policies and procedures, and better coordination of resources. However, it can also lead to bureaucracy, lack of innovation, and a disconnect between decision-makers and those who are affected by their decisions. As such, the benefits and drawbacks of centralized institutions depend on the specific context and the needs of the organization."

    institution_feminism_desc: "Feminism is an interdisciplinary approach to dealing with issues of equality and justice based on sex, gender, gender expression, gender identity, and other characteristics of sexuality as they are perceived via social theories and political action. Historically, feminism has evolved from a critique of gender inequality to a more in-depth analysis of the social and performative constructs of gender and sexuality. The current focus of feminist theory is to investigate injustices and inequality at the points where ability, class, gender, racism, and sex intersect. In cases where these intersections lead to unequal power relations, feminists also seek to correct those circumstances."
