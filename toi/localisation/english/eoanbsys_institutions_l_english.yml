 EOANBSYS_institutions_innovative_desc_5: "Mass production is the production of substantial quantities of standardized products in a constant flow, especially on assembly lines. Mass production techniques predate the Industrial Revolution by many centuries, but it was not until the early 19th century that modern mass production was possible on a large scale throughout many nations."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_innovative_desc_6: "Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, new efficient food production methods were introduced into developing countries, which led to a significant rise in the production of food grains (particularly wheat and rice). Significant quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides achieve much higher yields, which raises concerns about its expense and potential impact on the environment. Additionally, as a result, poor farmers' harvests have even lower yields under these new developments because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_innovative_desc_7: "Computing is the study and experimentation of algorithmic processes and the development of both hardware and software—having scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological, and social aspects. The term "computing" is also synonymous with counting and calculating, which was an occupation that fell into the hands of the human-computer prior to the invention of mechanical computing machines."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_innovative_desc_8: "The Internet, a system design that allows different computer networks all over the world to communicate, has transformed the way the world communicates and its methods of commerce. Every person who connects to one of its constituent networks has access to the Internet's vast and all-encompassing capabilities, which can be used for virtually any purpose. It enables human interaction through electronic mail, chat rooms, newsgroups, and audio/video transmission across long distances. A vast and expanding number of online businesses ("e-businesses") that conduct a majority services via the Internet have found success."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_innovative_desc_9: "Automation refers to a broad spectrum of technologies that minimize human involvement in processes. When decision criteria, subprocess linkages, and related actions are predetermined and implemented in machines, the need for human intervention is decreased. A massive industrial control system with tens of thousands of input measurements and output control signals is one example of an automation application, but it can also refer to smaller applications like a thermostat controlling a boiler. Control complexity can vary greatly, from straightforward on-off control to high-level multivariable algorithms simplified for easy everyday use."

 EOANBSYS_institutions_humanitive_desc_5: "Dogmatism is a belief(s) that are accepted by members of a group without being questioned or doubted. It may be in the form of an official system of principles or doctrines of a religion, such as Roman Catholicism, Judaism, or Protestantism. It is generally believed that pious adherents suffer from this rationale, and are unwilling to reason beyond their religion."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_humanitive_desc_6: "Globalization is how trade and technology have increased connectivity and interdependence around the world. The resulting economic and societal developments are also included in the scope of globalization. It can be visualized as the strands of a massive spider web that has grown in size and reached over thousands of years. In the modern era, this web of progress has expanded to reach more people and modernize more countries than ever before."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_humanitive_desc_7: "Environmentalism is the political and ethical movement that aims to change environmentally-damaging human behaviors by adopting political, economic, and social structures that reconsider how humans interact with the natural world and thought to be conducive to the betterment of the environment around society. In a variety of ways, environmentalism contends that while evaluating the morality of political, economic, and social policies, and to consider that entities other than humans and the natural world as a whole should be taken into account."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_humanitive_desc_8: "Social media platforms are interactive technologies that make it easier to form communities through online networks. In the current time, several social media services have been created, all of which share a collective set of features: web-based interactive apps, highly founded on user interaction, such as online discussions, communities, and group chats. This technology allows everyday people to remain connected even from afar."
 EOANBSYS_institutions_humanitive_desc_9: "Space colonization is the permanent habitation of and exploitation of natural resources on celestial bodies other than the planet Earth, going beyond human spaceflight and establishing interstellar outposts. It is the final form of human presence in space. Most people find the most challenging technological and financial hurdles to be involved in just building the necessary infrastructure, yet thanks to intensive research, the impossible is now possible."
