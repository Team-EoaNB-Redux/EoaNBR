 # Formation of KKK

 acw_reconstruction.6.desc: "In the city of Pulaski, Tennessee, a group of six former Confederate officers, Frank McCord, Richard Reed, John Lester, John Kennedy, J. Calvin Jones, and James Crowe, founded a group known as the "Ku Klux Klan." The KKK was a fraternal organization inspired by the "Sons of Malta." Throughout Reconstruction, the Ku Klux Klan perpetrated numerous atrocities against free black Americans, U.S. forces, and even elected officials. They did everything from thievery to murder to taking over government offices.\n\nAs the Federal government, it will be your job to deal with these terrorists, one way or another."

 acw_reconstruction.20.desc: "In recent Congressional elections in the South, it has apparently come out that many former Confederates have won seats to the United States Congress in some districts and even states. Many in government are concerned that these new representatives will work to undermine and disrupt federal government processes and even work towards giving more leniency for the South and ex-Confederates."
 acw_reconstruction.20.a: "There's not much we can do right now"

Many of them attempt to filibuster bills relating to Southern reconstruction all the time and have proposed bills to reduce rights for Freedmen and cut down federal presence in the South."

However, I'd like to make one proposition."\n\nThe general lifted his head from his chin and leaned forward with a grave expression on his face.\n\n"If you want to use the Army to combat these Klu Klux terrorists and protect the laws passed by Congress, you're going to need to destroy these terrorists quickly."\n\nHe let out a deep breath.\n\n"Grant me carte blanche to destroy the rebels in any way necessary, and I guarantee I can destroy them with minimal losses to our armed forces.""
