# Im giving serious thought to having some sort of limited conflict between the US and UK in ~1859/1860 over several disagreements the
# two had in those years. If UK refutes the clayton-bulwer treaty, the US will get pissy, but thats it. But if the british are then
# being shitty over the pig war as well, the pro-war faction will be stronger than it was historically. Obviously we would want this
# to be a fast war because, y'know, ACW. But in this case we could make it like a 120 day war via mission, where the US has to capture
# vancouver island, belize, and the moskito coast. The results of the war could be guatamala gets to keep belize like theyve claimed for 
# centuries, moskito goes to its historical owners, and something happens to the borders in Pacific NW. Obviously this would have to be 
# artfully crafted so both human players and AI are warned the US would be coming for them. I'm also picturing the US would get to use a 
# faction for this war, and leading up to the conflict can recruit the Central American countries most invested in making gains off of britain. 
# This limited war would guarantee more involvement by britain in the ACW, like a guarantee the alabama claims goes hot. This would also 
# encourage UK players to not go wild on expansion whenever future historical and a-historical content presents such an oppurtunity, because 
# now theyre going to be thinking about having to garrison everything.


# Idea eleventh august/022: Naval infrastructure law feels useless/under utilized rn, with the most serious effort to use it made by Enzo (o7),
# but when i was playing post meiji restoration, i always reverted by naval inf law after the focuses, because i didnt need it.
# Thus idea: Make it a use it or penalties national law. If you have no naval infrastructure, how are you building boats? Answer: you're not.
# By dint if youre not supplying your navy, youre not building one either. Broad idea outline, low levels of the law give up to -80% build
# speed on small ships, and -100% build speed on capital ships. This has delicious implications for later game content and things like naval
# build ups and more. This also will give players and AIs a reason to make use of the planned arms market/ship commission system, unindustrially
# focused nations are randomly building state fo the art BBs when that tech was effectively beyond them, even if they can research it in game,
# and large nations can defray the costs of their naval infrastructure (which WAS expensive) by arming other nations.
# This idea could also be extended to our other laws that "feel" useless, there's a land infrastructure law right? That could apply to stuff
# like roadways (giving worse supply distribution in core territory (need to figure out a way for other countries better/worse maintained roads
# to be taken into consideration)) AND ports. Military spending can give bonuses/maluses to military production/div training.

# Extension of the previous idea from yesterday, if keep the concept of Vic2 policies with the new parliament system (i.e. Jingoist, anti-military, etc.),
# we can have each change in ruling party or whatever trigger a scripted effect that checks what policies are in place, like naval infrastructure,
# and assign bonuses to political power/party popularity based on that. So jingoist parties are losing PP for not building up the army/navy
# and whatnot. 

# Yes I know Van said theyd work on culture before anything (and only after D&T), BUT, after that, perhaps parliament and then this as part of that

# Idea for naval doctrines 15/08/022: Naval doctrines will influence roles of gunboats vs monitors in the victorian era perhaps?

# Wrought iron of increasingly ridiculous thicknesses (iron clad) -> Compound Armor (im sorry garion but im really struggling to find any reference
# to steel-clad armor, like there is one reference where some french people at an italian armor competition in 1876 tried it, and beat wrought iron
# but it was also undesireable because it sounds like it was prone to defeat via wracking) -> Nickel Steel Armor -> Harvery Armor -> Krupp Chrome Armor 
# (I) -> Krupp Cemented Armor (II) (https://www.naval-history.net/WW0Book-USN-Armour1937.htm#steel) -> (investigate further Special Treatment Steel

step one of naval commission system can be generic decision "Outsource Modern Naval Supplies" for faster shipbuilding in return for political power, later money
