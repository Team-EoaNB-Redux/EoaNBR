# Im giving serious thought to having some sort of limited conflict between the US and UK in ~1859/1860 over several disagreements the
# two had in those years. If UK refutes the clayton-bulwer treaty, the US will get pissy, but thats it. But if the british are then
# being shitty over the pig war as well, the pro-war faction will be stronger than it was historically. Obviously we would want this
# to be a fast war because, y'know, ACW. But in this case we could make it like a 120 day war via mission, where the US has to capture
# vancouver island, belize, and the moskito coast. The results of the war could be guatamala gets to keep belize like theyve claimed for 
# centuries, moskito goes to its historical owners, and something happens to the borders in Pacific NW. Obviously this would have to be 
# artfully crafted so both human players and AI are warned the US would be coming for them. I'm also picturing the US would get to use a 
# faction for this war, and leading up to the conflict can recruit the Central American countries most invested in making gains off of britain. 
# This limited war would guarantee more involvement by britain in the ACW, like a guarantee the alabama claims goes hot. This would also 
# encourage UK players to not go wild on expansion whenever future historical and a-historical content presents such an oppurtunity, because 
# now theyre going to be thinking about having to garrison everything.


# Idea eleventh august/022: Naval infrastructure law feels useless/under utilized rn, with the most serious effort to use it made by Enzo (o7),
# but when i was playing post meiji restoration, i always reverted by naval inf law after the focuses, because i didnt need it.
# Thus idea: Make it a use it or penalties national law. If you have no naval infrastructure, how are you building boats? Answer: you're not.
# By dint if youre not supplying your navy, youre not building one either. Broad idea outline, low levels of the law give up to -80% build
# speed on small ships, and -100% build speed on capital ships. This has delicious implications for later game content and things like naval
# build ups and more. This also will give players and AIs a reason to make use of the planned arms market/ship commission system, unindustrially
# focused nations are randomly building state fo the art BBs when that tech was effectively beyond them, even if they can research it in game,
# and large nations can defray the costs of their naval infrastructure (which WAS expensive) by arming other nations.
# This idea could also be extended to our other laws that "feel" useless, there's a land infrastructure law right? That could apply to stuff
# like roadways (giving worse supply distribution in core territory (need to figure out a way for other countries better/worse maintained roads
# to be taken into consideration)) AND ports. Military spending can give bonuses/maluses to military production/div training.

# Extension of the previous idea from yesterday, if keep the concept of Vic2 policies with the new parliament system (i.e. Jingoist, anti-military, etc.),
# we can have each change in ruling party or whatever trigger a scripted effect that checks what policies are in place, like naval infrastructure,
# and assign bonuses to political power/party popularity based on that. So jingoist parties are losing PP for not building up the army/navy
# and whatnot. 

# Yes I know Van said theyd work on culture before anything (and only after D&T), BUT, after that, perhaps parliament and then this as part of that

# Idea for naval doctrines 15/08/022: Naval doctrines will influence roles of gunboats vs monitors in the victorian era perhaps?

# Wrought iron of increasingly ridiculous thicknesses (iron clad) -> Compound Armor (im sorry garion but im really struggling to find any reference
# to steel-clad armor, like there is one reference where some french people at an italian armor competition in 1876 tried it, and beat wrought iron
# but it was also undesireable because it sounds like it was prone to defeat via wracking) -> Nickel Steel Armor -> Harvery Armor -> Krupp Chrome Armor

#after fire tube boilers, engines shouldnt be divided into 3 subclasses, but should focus on something like draught (i.e. forced draught) that makes the difference between fuel consumption.

#fire control slot currently starts with crows nest which gives spotting bonuses, little to do with fire control, should modules be split into actual fire control modules and spotting modules? Put them in the same slot for player choice?

#we need 2 more classes of armored cruiser, at least 1 between 1875 and 1888, this is where USS Maine would go, the 2nd would be after 1888, seeing as how armored cruisers were still being built in 20th cent.

#We need at least engine increment buttons in the designer, more techs to add, player choice, but also good for balancing ironclad speed. Via upgrade, increase in speed value, negative modifier, soft cap on speed.

#source on prussian doctrine contrasted with others, keyword schnell https://www.cuttersguide.com/pdf/Military-and-Uniforms/the-franco-prussian-war-the-german-conquest-of-france-in-1870-1871.pdf : addiitonal notes, 600 men in 1 cavalry regiment, doctrine based? 1200 in brigade of 2 regiments. "platoon leaders strung out troops in skirmish order" to combat cavalry, revolutionary, steel breastplates remain rifle proof at middling range?!, omfg i love this source! literally crying

#<Tactic>_preferred_weight_factor ; combat_width_factor ; org_loss_when_moving ; very important for doctrines

#prussian doctrines: extended order, something relating to artillery?, schnell-feuer (early mad-minute), terraingewinn (conquered ground) the only way to accurately judge success in battle, focus on flanking aggresively (combat width bonus?), Kesselschlachten (encirclement battles) using telegraph to plan and synchronize attacks org bonus to telegraph companies, something general staff planning bonus and speed, Auftragstaktik “mission tactics” (small unit tactics, platoon/section, 20 men)

#french doctrines: feu de battalion, specifically introduced after 7ww (battle of konnigratz), sounds like rank fire but with breechloaders, tactics (probably means strategy) at large described as defensive?, furia francese also referred to as storm columns?, furia francese maybe older, Adolphe Niel adopted defensive TACTICS, soldiers trained to dig 3ft shelter trenches in 25m entrenchment speed boost, engineer companies made stronger, focus on accuracy soft attack; limited volleys no more than 5 shots, org + soft attack?, leads directly into feu de battalion; heavy skirmish groups of limited utilty, +1 tactic skirmish # dont forget the big recon expeditions if that can be worked into anything

#american doctrine: highly standardized training gives div training time bonus, field entrenchments gives entrenchment speed buff, 

#british doctrine: special forces cap increase for marines (marines_special_forces_contribution_factor), naval bombardment bonus, naval research bonus, marine supply grace, naval invasion stuff

#artillery: grand batteries vs massed artillery. Grand should involve increasing the size of artillery companies (for width and eq) or maybe battalions, massed artillery should involve maybe giving each inf battalion artillery

#cavalry: combat vs support. Combat will increase cav regiment size from 500 to 600, perhaps a middle path that will buff dragoons/mounted infantry, support will increase recon ability
